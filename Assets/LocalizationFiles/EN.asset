    value: I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,
      and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto,
      I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December. Much was
      I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already
      sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following
      Monday.
